# 5 Step Process to answering a coding problem

1. Echo back to make sure you understand. Put it into your own words. *ASK QUESTIONS IF SOMETHING IS UNCLEAR*. You can offer your own examples and ask if they are correct.
2. State your assumptions and constraints
3. Psuedocode / plain language solution. Test your theory without writing code.
4. Code it!
5. Test and Refactor

# Common Questions to ask

- Do I care about space complexity or time complexity?
  - time complexity is how much time your solution takes up relative to the input
  - space complexity is how much space / memory your solution takes up relative to the input

# Decoding Coding Problems

- *given* means you will get something as an input.

# Key Things
- Coding Interview
  - It's more about how you *think*
  - Timed
  - Looking for data structures, algorithms knowledge
  - Using a whiteboard or Google Docs (no IDE)
  - Usually, the programming language doesn't matter

- Pair Programming Interview
  - Communication is important!
