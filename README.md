# 7 Step Process to answering a coding problem

1. Understand the problem. Ask questions, look for keywords, etc.
2. Parrot back / rubber duck your understanding of the problem. You can create your own examples. State your assumptions!
3. Try to recognize a solution or pattern from previous code you've written.
4. Build a plan with pseudo code.
5. Test the plan manually a few times. Revise as needed.
6. Once you are convinced the plan is good, tranlsate it into code.
7. Refactor if you have time.

# Common Questions to ask

- Should I care about space complexity or time complexity?
  - time complexity is how much time your solution takes up relative to the input
  - space complexity is how much space / memory your solution takes up relative to the input

# Decoding Coding Problems

- *given* means you will get something as an input.

# Key Things
- Coding Interview
  - It's more about how you *think*
  - Timed
  - Looking for data structures, algorithms knowledge
  - Using a whiteboard or Google Docs (no IDE)
  - Usually, the programming language doesn't matter

- Pair Programming Interview
  - Communication is important!
