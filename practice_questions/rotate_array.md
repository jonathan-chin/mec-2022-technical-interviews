# Problem

Given an array, rotate the array by one position in a clock wise direction.

# Examples
input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
output: [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]

input: [9,8, 7, 6, 4, 2, 1, 3]
output: [3, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4, 2, 1]





# notes
is this to be done in js?
any language you feel comfortable that

what about an empty array?
return an empty array

what about an array of size 1?
return the same array

time complexity: O(n)
space complexity: I don't care

final project for 246 -> similar code
